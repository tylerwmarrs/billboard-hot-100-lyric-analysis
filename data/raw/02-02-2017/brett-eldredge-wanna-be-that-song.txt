The radio and a sundress
Makin' my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and the truth spin
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speaks
Sing every word of Night Moves
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years, once disappeared
Makes time stall
wanna be those words
that fill you up, roll your windows down
and keeps you young
makes you believe you're right where you belong
i wanna that song
i wanna be wanna be wanna be that song
ooh
i wanna be
i wanna
i wanna
i wanna stand with you in the third row
the window booth at a bar
back pew on a Sunday, pourin' out your heart
When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin'
and you need something to take you home
let me be that song that gets you high
makes you dance, makes you fall
that melody rewinds years
once disappeared, makes time stall
wanna be those words that fill you up,
roll your windows down and keeps you young
makes you believe you're right where you belong
i wanna be song
i wanna be wanna be wanna be
wanna be that song
ooh
i wanna be
i wanna i wanna
when you're searching the horizon
when your eyes look back
when you're standing in the moment,
every life has a soundtrack
ooh
i wanna be
i wanna be
ooh i wanna be
i wanna be that song that gets you high
makes you dance, makes you fall
that melody rewinds years
once disappeared, makes time stall
wanna be those words that fill you up,
roll your windows down and keeps you young
makes you believe you're right where you belong
i wanna be that song
when the highway's callin'
when the bottle's dry
when the sky is fallin'
and you're asking yourself why
ooh
i wanna be
yeahhh
oooooh
