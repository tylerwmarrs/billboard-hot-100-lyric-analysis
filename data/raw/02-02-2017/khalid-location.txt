[Hook]
Send me your location lets
Focus on communicating cuz
I just need the time and place to come through
(A chance to come through)
Send me your location lets
Ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 1]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it

[Hook]
So won't you send me, your location lets
Focus on communicating cuz
I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location lets
Ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets so
Let's keep personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this cuz I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
I might make you mine by the night

[Outro]
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you
