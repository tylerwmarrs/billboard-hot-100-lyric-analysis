[Verse 1]
Still runs good, built to last
Moves like a hula girl on the dash
She ain't made for practicality
Yeah, I guess she's just like me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio I'm ready to roll

[Chorus]
Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head hell I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades pretty in pink
Call me old school but hey

I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes
I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes

[Verse 2]
Pop the top down like a summer dream
She's my teenage time machine
Just keeps getting sweeter with age
She's classic through any decade

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The suns in the sky, glitter on the seats
You can try, but the Benz is hard to beat
So, hey, if you want you can ride with me

[Chorus]
Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head hell I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades pretty in pink
Call me old school but hey

I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes
I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's Saturday night, about time to go
Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
Once I turn on the radio I'm ready to roll

[Chorus]
Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
Turning every head hell I ain't even trying
Got them Ray-Ban shades pretty in pink
Call me old school but hey

I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes
I'm a 90's baby
In my 80's Mercedes
