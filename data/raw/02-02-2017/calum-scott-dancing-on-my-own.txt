Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can?
And there's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, I bet she's around

And yeah, I know it's stupid
But I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oohh
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh oohh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, oohh
I keep dancing on my own

I just wanna dance all night
And I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line, yeah
Stilettos and broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles

And I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oohh
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh oohh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, oohh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh no

So far away but still so near
The lights come up, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oohh
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, oohh
And I keep dancing on my own
And oh no
Said I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh no
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh no
And I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, oohh
I keep dancing on my own

So far away, but still so near
The lights come up, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here.
