Wooohhhh

You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, set me free
The finest years I ever knew
were all the years I had with you

And I would give everything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
just to have you once again

You taught me how to laugh
What a time, what a time
You never said too much
but still you showed you cared
And I knew from watching you

Nobody else could ever know
the part of me that can't let go

And I would give everything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
just to have you once again
just to have you once again

Is there someone you know
you're loving them so
but taking them all for granted?
You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
and they don't hear the words you long to say

I would give everything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
just to have you
I would give everything I own
everything I own (I'd give up my life, my heart, my home)
My home (I would give everything I own)
everything, everything I own
Just to have you

I would give everything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
I'd give up my life, my heart, my home

I would give
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey

Everything, everything that I own
Everything, everything that I own
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey

Woooohhhhhh
