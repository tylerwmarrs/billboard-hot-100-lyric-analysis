I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Nothing feels like home
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone
Trying to find my way back home to you
