Quavo!
Lifestyle on camera
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier
They tried to turn me to an animal
But white people think I'm radical
Supermodels think I'm handsome
You might think I'm too aggressive
But really I think I'm too passive
'Till I pull out the chopper, start blasting

1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go

Pray for me
I'm about to hit the Ye button
I don't wanna say nothin' wrong
But it'd be wrong if I ain't say nothin'
Imagine if I ain't say somethin'
Wouldn't none these niggas say nothin'
I done lost and made money
Now I'm makin' somethin' they can't take from me
Now I'm fresh out of debt in this mothafucka!
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka!
Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on
I'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store

Fresh out the feds in this mothafucka
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka
Gucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on
Now that Gucci's home, it's over for you Gucci clones

1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round they go
Round and round they go

Look, I say a prayer for my enemies
They cannot slow down what's meant for me
Funny how they come around like I can't see through their secret identities
Lately it's all about Zen and me
Subtractin' the negative energy
With the family, turn your ass to a memory
My niggas team of the century
I blow the check up, nigga, detonation
Kill 'em one by one, Final Destination
Time my destination
I got guardian angels all around a nigga, that's deflecting Satan
I'm a mothafuckin' champion
This right here the fuckin' anthem
I can't dap you without hand san'
I don't know where your dirty ass hands been
I wake up to like a hundred texts
Championship team, but we can't cut the net
She all off in my jersey lookin' underdressed
I'm finna buy this bitch a Honda CRX
With 1500...

1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go, round and round they go
Round and round they go
Rather be trappin' up out of the bowl
Then to get down with a ho

I took a nap in the pulpit
I never like how a suit fit
I got a pocket full of money
It got me walkin' all slew-foot
I'm on my wave like a cruise ship
In that hoe's mouth like a toothpick
Anyone get in my way
Nothin' to say, I tote them choppas like pool sticks
I wear pajamas to Ruth's Chris
Couldn't walk a mile in my new kicks
I come and find your apartments
We never had our damn pool fixed
Walk in the mall with my new bitch
Tell her to get the whole rack
My new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch
Then pull me a new bitch
See that is a snowball effect
I got gold on my neck
Lookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck
I got a mansion full of marble floors
It look like I could go bowl in this bitch
Versace nigga got hoes in this bitch
Like I'm a serial killer
I put the real in gorilla
I did this shit for my niggas

1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go, round and round they go
Round and round they go
Rather be trappin' up out of the bowl
Then to get down with a ho
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round they go
Round and round they go, round and round they go
Round and round they go
Rather be trappin' up out of the bowl
Then to get down with a ho

I'm Yo Gotti!
Reach for my chain is suicide
The car I drive fit two inside
They mad at Ye cause he all in the neighborhood
But he let them goons inside
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Let's fuck up the neighborhood
Buy every house in this bitch
You know that the money good
My racks in the kitchen go round and round
Play with the key and I'ma gun you down
The roof on that Wraith in the lost and found
Official trapper let me show it down
More shit than a Pamper
All we rock is bandanas
Whips so nasty, no manners
I just got head in a Phantom

She say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ
She say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp
1017's the Squad, Gucci Mane's the stamp
And he don't ever sleep, he's a fuckin' vamp
I heard your bitch ride on the bus, you don't give a damn
My bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am
I love my Auntie Jean, but fuck Uncle Sam
I'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram
Niggas never test the kid so I don't have to cram
My city treat me like a king, I should wear a crown
And I don't really fuck around
I gave my bitch two mil' cause she stuck around

1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go, round and round they go
Round and round they go
Rather be trappin' up out of the bowl
Then to get down with a ho
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round they go
Round and round they go, round and round they go
Round and round they go
Rather be trappin' up out of the bowl
Then to get down with a ho
