When I'm sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
Well I'm gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today

You keep brushing that hair back outta your eyes
And it just keeps falling and so do I
Well I'm feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today

I don't know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life

Well I know it won't always be like this
Life can change as quick as a kiss
It's not over yet and I already miss
Today

And as the seasons change and time goes by
When your hair is grey and so is mine
know for sure that you're gonna be just as beautiful
As you are to me today.

Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, right now the whole world is right
Bring on tomorrow

Because the memory of a day like today
Can get you through the rest of your life
