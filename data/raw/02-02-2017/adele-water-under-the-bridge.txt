No, you won't find out why we've been growing apart in each others wounds
The gap is widening by leaps and bounds
No, you won't find out why we turned off the spark laying deep down
Water has flowed under the bridge and now it's drowned

No, you won't find me knocking on the door like I'm stuck outside
'cause I don't care anymore, you can keep my pride
And you won't find me standing on the porch in the pouring rain
I've made no mistakes but I can take the blame

Time is running out, and I'm about to leave
I'm not going to speak
Time is running out, and I'm about to leave
I don't wanna speak to you

'cause this is the last thing I would wanna do, I'm not gonna strive
I just want my heart back and stay alive
I'm not a hungry dog who barks all night long
I'm just an angry kid, I carry my burdens along

Time is running out, and I'm about to leave
Time is running out, I don't wanna speak to you
'cause this is the last thing i would wanna do.
