Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in the city I know
Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losin' control
You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold
I want the good life
Every good night you're a hot one to hold
Cause you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap
Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in the city I know
Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losin' control
You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold
I want your sex and your affection when I'm holding you close
Cause you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap
Every night when the stars come out
Am I the only living soul around?
Need to believe you could hold me down
Cause I'm in need of something good right now
We could be screaming till the sun comes out
And when we wake we be the only sound
Get off my knees and say a prayer James Brown
Bet I can make your hands clap
Bet I can make your hands clap
(Turn it up)
Bet I can make your hands clap
My fresh is searching for your worst and rest dont ever deny
I'm like a stranger, give me danger
All your wrongs and your rights
secrets on broadway to the freeway, you're a keeper of crimes
Feel no conviction, grapes of wrath can only sweeten your wine
But you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap
Every night when the stars come out
Am I the only living soul around?
Need to believe you could hold me down
Cause I'm in need of something good right now
We could be screaming till the sun comes out
And when we wake we be the only sound
Get off my knees and say a prayer James Brown
Bet I can make your hands clap
Bet I can make your hands clap
Bet I can make your hands clap
Bet I can make your hands clap
So can I get a hand clap?
