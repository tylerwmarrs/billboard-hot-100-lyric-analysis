[Intro: Kyle + Lil Yachty]
Man fuck...
What's wrong Kyle?
Man these...kids man, talking shit, making me feel bad
Man...fuck them kids bro. Look around bro, look at life
Man you're right
Mn...you see, you see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on man, you got so much more to appreciate man
Man you know what...y-you're right
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was goddamn wrong
Man thanks Lil Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: Kyle]
I ain't been gettin' high...well maybe a little, baby I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's coming at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always tell the clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I am just like the DeRozen, if I shoot it, it goes in
I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah, I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06
I ain't cried since '01, my bag like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though, your friend named Cupid is fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Hook: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, nevermind
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, nevermind

[Post-Hook: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
She said she twenty-one, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember riding around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I [?] and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screening out the lane
Went from "Damn this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my tee
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me, no, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

Oh, I...I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, nevermind

Oh I, I spy with my little eye
