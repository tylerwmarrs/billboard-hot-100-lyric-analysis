The moon outside, too bright, those blinds, yeah lets just keep them closed,
You know, my hands they know where to go, to find your finger tips,
Trace them back to your lips, take you on a trip, flip that switch

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing your doing there, brush me with your hair, I swear
I don't know how long that I can last,
Make my world go black, black, make my world black, black

Like your dress on the floor, yeah the one you don't need anymore,
Black like a sky with no stars, just find me and fall into my arms

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing your doing there, brush me with your hair, I swear
I don't know how long that I can last,
Make my world go black, black, make my world black, black

I don't wanna see a thing, baby I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush,
I don't wanna see a thing, I just wanna feel your love

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing your doing there, brush me with your hair, I swear
I don't know how long that I can last,
Make my world go black, black, make my world black, black

Make my world go black
I don't wanna see a thing, I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush
