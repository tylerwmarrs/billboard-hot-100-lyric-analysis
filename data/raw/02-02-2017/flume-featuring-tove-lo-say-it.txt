Feeling the song, party done
Shadows walking home
Walking with our game on
You are my kind, classic mind
And you look so fine
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Loving the cold, smoke a roll
See your fingers shake
I'm getting through your heart break
Some kinda freak, sing for me
Don't know what I need
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Don't doubt me babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...
Bite me babe
You make me love the pain
Break my bed to make me wanna stay

I can't...

When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me falling right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me fuck you right back

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

I'm getting the door, silent walk
Who's the first to speak?
Speak it like a real freak
Voice in my head, in my bed
Filled with you instead
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Taking your time, work my mind
And I play with you
I play pretend it's so true

Follow me down
Listen 'round to the deep dark sound
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Don't doubt me babe
You make me wanna change
