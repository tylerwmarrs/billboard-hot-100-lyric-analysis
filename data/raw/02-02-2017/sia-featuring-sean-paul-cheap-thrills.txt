Up with it, girl
Rock with it, girl (Sia)
Show dem it, girl
Bada bang bang

Bounce with it, girl
Dance with it, girl
Get with it, girl
Bada bang bang

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night, and it won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's Friday night, and it won't be long

Till I hit the dance floor (bada bang)
Hit the dance floor (bada bang)
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby (just you and me)

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I love cheap thrills!
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I love cheap thrills!

But I don't need no money
U worth more dan diamond, more dan gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus tek control

I don't need no money
U worth more dan diamond, more dan gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up urself, get outa control

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday, and it won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday, and it won't be long

Till I hit the dance floor (bada bang)
Hit the dance floor (bada bang)
