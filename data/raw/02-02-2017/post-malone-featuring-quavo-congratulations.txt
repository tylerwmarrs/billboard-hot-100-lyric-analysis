New shit
Ay, ay, ay, ay
New shit
Let's go

My mama called, see you on TV
Said some shit done changed
You actually was
And I dreamed it all
Ever since I was young
They said I would be number one
Say congratulations
Worked so hard forgot how to vacation
Ay, they ain't never had the dedication
People hate, say we changed but look we made it
Yeah, we made it

Days were (?)
Now I'm jumping out in Paris
And I know I'm the man, yeah
And I know a bad habit, yeah
For the money I'm a savage, yeah
How easily I handle it, yeah
Cost 120 bad bitches but they didn't know me last year
Everyone wanna act like they important
But I (?) we lost for my dog yeah
Everyone counting on me, drop the bars yeah
Everything costing like (?) the bars yeah
If you fucking with it, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make sense when I got B's on my ride
Coming with a bougie, I just pulled her to the side
(?) so petty they can see (?)

My mama called, see you on TV
