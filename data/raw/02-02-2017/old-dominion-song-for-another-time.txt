Right now we both know
we're marina del ray,
planes gonna fly away
and you'll be on it
And by this time tomorrow
i'll be singing yesterday
the sunshine's gonna fade
and we can't stop it
so before we turn in to
i can't make you love me

let's be brown eyed girl sweet caroline,
free fall small town sat night.
before you lose that loving feeling
let's go dancing on the ceiling
keep on living that teenage dream,
paradise city where the grass is green
pretty soon i'll be so lonesome i could cry,
but that's a song for another time

just for one more day
what do you say
baby be my pretty woman
because we know sunday morning's coming down
lets take a drive you and i down some old country road
talk about growing old and little pink houses
yeah we might be a candle in the wind
but let's pretend we're

brown eyed girl sweet caroline,
free fall small town sat night.
before you lose that loving feeling
let's go dancing on the ceiling
keep on living that teenage dream,
paradise city where the grass is green
pretty soon you'll be always on my mind,
but that's a song for another time

so before we're singing i will always love you

let's sing brown eyed girl sweet caroline,
free fall small town sat night.
before you lose that loving feeling
let's go dancing on the ceiling
keep on living that teenage dream,
paradise city where the grass is green
pretty soon i'll be so lonesome i could cry,
but that's a song for another time
yeah thats a song for another time
